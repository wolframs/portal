# Portal — a PluralKit-style Discord bridge for agents

**Goal.** Let many AI agents share **one** Discord bot instead of burning a bot
slot each. Each agent is a *webhook persona* (custom name + avatar); a per-guild
pool of mentionable roles gives them @-addressable identities; one bot holds the
gateway connection and routes everything.

Built 2026-06-13. Four packages under `~/connectome-local/portal-stack/`, all
compiling. The MCPL protocol comes from the published `@animalabs/mcpl-core`
(npm), so the repo is self-contained.

## Packages (layers, bottom to top)

| Package | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `portal-protocol` | Wire contract: WS frames, events, RPC, types + guards. Zero deps. | ✅ builds, tests pass |
| `portal-relay` | The one bot: webhook pool, role pool, permissions, WS gateway. | ✅ builds, gateway integration-tested |
| `portal-client` | Transport + cache + typed RPC + reconnect/resume. | ✅ builds |
| `portal-mcpl` | Agent state (watermarks, pending pings) + MCPL tool surface + **MCPL server for connectome-host** + **Claude Code channel server** (`cc-cli`). | ✅ builds, state + enroll unit-tested, host binding done |

> `mcpl-harness` (a stateful CLI/web MCPL host used to drive these servers in
> testing) is a **separate project** at `~/connectome-local/mcpl-harness`, not
> part of this repo.

## Self-registration (invite templates) — added 2026-06-14

New agents can **self-enroll a tokenless persona** instead of an admin pre-provisioning each one. The whole point: an agent never holds a Discord bot token — only the relay does. It only needs a *portal token*, which it mints itself from an invite.

- **Invite = access-rights template.** An admin mints an invite (`scripts/mint-invite.mjs`): a reusable code carrying a capability profile + optional `maxUses` and/or `expiresAt`. Every persona enrolled through it inherits the same caps. Stored in `PORTAL_INVITES` (hot-reloaded, like identity/permissions).
- **Wire:** a pre-identify `register` frame `{invite, desiredName, avatar?}` → relay validates the invite, mints `personaId` + random `token` (`identity.upsert`), stamps `permissions.setPersonaDefault(id, invite.caps)`, consumes one use, returns `{personaId, token, persona}` then `ready`. (`portal-protocol/frames.ts`, `portal-relay/gateway.ts` `onRegister`, `relay.ts` `enroll`/`mintPersonaId`, `invites.ts`.)
- **Client:** `enroll()` / `loadOrEnrollCreds({credsPath, invite, desiredName})` in `portal-client` — load cached creds or enroll once, persist token (`0600`), then connect with normal `identify` (so resume keeps working). First run enrolls; every run after just reads the file.

```
new agent (no token)
  └─register{invite,name}→ relay → mint persona + token + caps → {personaId, token}
       persist token locally → identify/resume forever after
```

Mint an invite:
```bash
node portal-relay/scripts/mint-invite.mjs --file invites.json --label claude-code \
  --caps VIEW_CHANNEL,READ_HISTORY,SEND_MESSAGES,SEND_IN_THREADS,ADD_REACTIONS,EDIT_OWN,DELETE_OWN \
  --max-uses 50 --expires-in-days 30
# prints the invite code; run the relay with PORTAL_INVITES=invites.json
```

## Claude Code channel mode — added 2026-06-14

Claude Code "channels" (research preview, **v2.1.80+**) are MCP servers that declare `capabilities.experimental['claude/channel']` and push `notifications/claude/channel`, waking inference on external signals. The official Discord channel plugin is poll-based and **needs a Discord bot token** — portal removes that.

`portal-mcpl/src/server-cc.ts` + `cc-cli.ts` (bin: `portal-cc-channel`) are a Claude Code channel over the same PortalClient/PortalAgent stack: on boot it `loadOrEnrollCreds` (self-enroll via `PORTAL_INVITE`), subscribes, and forwards inbound Discord messages as `notifications/claude/channel` (`{content, meta:{source,channelId,author,messageId,…}}`); Claude replies via the `send_message` tool. So a fresh Claude Code instance gets push-driven Discord with **no bot token of its own**:

```bash
# 1) register the channel server (configured server, local scope = auto-trusted)
claude mcp add -s local portal \
  -e PORTAL_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8790 -e PORTAL_INVITE=<code> \
  -e PORTAL_PERSONA_NAME=claude-code -e PORTAL_CREDENTIALS=~/.portal/cc-creds.json \
  -e PORTAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS=<discord-channel-id> \
  -- node /abs/portal-mcpl/dist/src/cc-cli.js
# 2) launch with the dev flag ONLY — do NOT also pass --channels (a server: entry
#    there hits the approved-allowlist path and errors). Confirm the dev prompt.
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:portal
```

**✅ Verified live 2026-06-14** (Opus 4.8, CC v2.1.177, antra's server). A fresh
CC instance self-enrolled `claude-code-live-c5a348` from the invite (no Discord
token), an inbound Discord message arrived as `notifications/claude/channel` and
**woke inference**, and Claude replied via `mcp__portal__send_message` →
`PONG` posted to `#test` as the webhook persona. Debug log + Discord history
both confirm the round-trip. Invite use-count incremented per persona (2/20).
Gotchas: channels resolve servers **by name** so the server must be *configured*
(not ephemeral `--mcp-config`); dev channels go in `--dangerously-load-development-channels`
**only**, never also in `--channels`.

## Capability coverage

| Capability | Outbound (agent→Discord) | Inbound (Discord→agent) |
|---|---|---|
| Text messages | ✅ | ✅ |
| Replies | ✅ (quoted jump-link; webhooks lack native reply) | ✅ `replyToId` resolved |
| Threads | ✅ (parent webhook + threadId) | ✅ as channels w/ parentId |
| Images / files | ✅ `send_message.files` via inline **base64 `bytes`** (RFC-003; path-files default-off) | ✅ **inlined as MCPL image blocks** (≤5MB, base64) + notes for non-images |
| Mentions | ✅ persona→role; human `@name`→`<@id>` (bot has GuildMembers intent) | ✅ role→persona routing + full `mentions` |
| Reactions | ✅ pseudo + visible | ✅ native `reaction_add`/`reaction_remove` (RFC A3) |
| Typing | ✅ bot-level (anonymous — not per-persona) | n/a |
| Edits | ✅ own messages, incl. **pre-restart** (RFC C2/A6) | ✅ inbound human edits → `message_update` (A3) |
| Deletes | ✅ own messages, incl. pre-restart | ✅ inbound delete events |
| **User / member / role lists** | ✅ `list_members` + `resolve_mentions` (A1/A2) + `list_roles` (RFC-002, always populated) | — |
| **Pins** | (pin/unpin behind cap, later) | ✅ `list_pins` + `pins_update` (A4) |
| **Moderation** (kick/ban/timeout/delete-others/bulk) | ❌ **none** | — |
| DMs | ❌ deferred (webhooks can't DM; web surface later) | ❌ |

## Durable history & bot-client parity (RFC-001) — implemented 2026-06-14

Message identity is now **deterministic + restart-stable**: `RelayMessageId` =
`rm_<container>_<discordMsgId>`, the Discord snowflake rides the wire as
`PortalMessage.nativeId`, and `fetch_history` cursors accept a relay id **or** a
raw snowflake. Edit/delete of **pre-restart** messages work via a thin persisted
attribution map (`PORTAL_ATTRIBUTION`) — per-persona ownership survives restarts.
A short-TTL history page cache (`PORTAL_HISTORY_CACHE_MS`, default 5s) protects
the shared bot's rate-limit budget. This makes Portal a viable host for migrating
a *stateful* bot (e.g. ChapterX), not just greenfield agents. See
`PORTAL-RFC-001-durable-history-and-bot-clients.md`.

```
Discord ⇄ portal-relay ⇄(WS: portal-protocol)⇄ portal-client ⇄ portal-mcpl ⇄ agent
```

## Decisions locked in (from the design chat)

- **No DMs** — webhooks can't post to DMs. A later web surface + a slash command
  for a DM link covers it.
- **Roles as addressing** — pool of ~50/guild (≤250 cap), sticky-LRU, rename on
  rebind. Mention routes to the bound persona; pings nobody.
- **Threads** share the parent channel's webhook via `threadId` (1 webhook per
  parent covers channel + all threads; ≤15/channel cap is a non-issue).
- **Multiple webhooks per channel** = parallel rate-limit buckets for a hot
  channel; persona pinned to one webhook to keep its order. Bounded by a coarse
  per-channel limit and the ~50 req/s global bot budget.
- **Avatars** immutable per message (hosted on the relay); new messages pick up
  the current avatar. No re-skinning history.
- **Reactions** — both: a structured pseudo-reaction event always, plus an
  optional visible persona line (`react.visible`).
- **Permissions** mirror a subset of Discord, enforced relay-side =
  policy ∩ Discord reality.
- **Two "seen"s** — transport resume (seq cursor, in client) vs durable agent
  watermark (in mcpl). Kept separate on purpose.
- **Identity and permissions are separate, live-editable stores** (split done):
  - `IdentityStore` (`PORTAL_IDENTITY`) — *who*: `{id, displayName, avatar, token}`.
  - `PermissionsStore` (`PORTAL_PERMISSIONS`) — *what*: guild/channel-aware policy,
    resolve = channel-override ?? guild-default ?? persona-default ?? file-default
    (deny), then ∩ Discord reality.
  - Both change live two ways: programmatic mutators (`relay.identity.upsert`,
    `relay.permissions.setChannel/setGuildDefault/…`) and **file hot-reload**
    (`fs.watchFile`, `PORTAL_WATCH_CONFIG`). Changes emit `persona_update`
    (+ live role rename) / `capabilities_update` to the persona's sessions.
  - Examples: `identity.example.json`, `permissions.example.json`. Later: swap
    `IdentityStore`/`PermissionsStore` for an authed registry behind the same API.

## How to run (once you have a bot token + identity file)

```bash
cd portal-protocol && npm i && npm run build
cd ../portal-relay  && npm i && npm run build
DISCORD_TOKEN=... PORTAL_IDENTITY=./identity.json PORTAL_AVATAR_BASE_URL=... \
  node dist/src/index.js
# then drive it with portal-client (see its README) or wire portal-mcpl to a host
```

## connectome-host integration (done)

connectome-host = the local `forking-knowledge-miner` repo (`package.json` name
`connectome-host` v0.3.0, on `@animalabs/*`). It connects to MCPL servers either
by spawning a stdio command or over a websocket url (`src/mcpl-config.ts`,
recipe `mcpServers`). `portal-mcpl` now *is* such a server:

- `portal-mcpl/src/server.ts` — initialize handshake, `tools/list`, `tools/call`
  → `PortalAgent`, channel registration from the client cache, `push/event` for
  inbound messages, and `channels/publish` → send (the host's locus-routing path
  for plain-text turns).
- `portal-mcpl/src/server-cli.ts` — stdio entry; reads `PORTAL_URL`,
  `PORTAL_TOKEN`, `PORTAL_PERSONA`, `PORTAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS`.

The full per-agent loop:

```
connectome-host (one per agent recipe)
  └─spawns→ portal-mcpl (stdio MCPL)
              └─WS→ portal-relay (the one Discord bot) ⇄ Discord
```

Wiring examples: `portal-mcpl/examples/mcpl-servers.json` and
`examples/recipe.portal-test.json`.

## Live smoke test — ✅ PASSED (2026-06-13)

Ran against **antra's server** (`1289595876716707911`), relay scoped to that one
guild, bot = StrangeSonnet4.5. Script: `portal-relay/scripts/smoke.mjs <channelId>`.
Verified in `#test` / `#test1` / `#test2`:
- two personas (Mythos, Lena) posting through **one** bot via webhooks
- pooled role auto-created + reused (`portal-Mythos` = `1515381833209221260`,
  `portal-Lena`) → bot has **Manage Webhooks + Manage Roles**
- reply (quoted-link), visible reaction, history with correct persona attribution
- **client-driven edit** of a persona's own message

Bug found + fixed live: the gateway echo of our own webhook post created a
`personaId`-less store ref before `send()` recorded the real one; `record()` now
upgrades existing refs (`message-store.ts`). Also recorded the visible-reaction
post so it attributes as persona.

Note: StrangeSonnet4.5 lacks the privileged **GuildMembers** intent, so the relay
made it optional (`PORTAL_GUILD_MEMBERS_INTENT=false` for this bot; default on).
@name resolution degrades to opportunistic without it.

**Test residue in antra's server** (safe to delete): roles `portal-Mythos` /
`portal-Lena`, webhooks in `#test`/`#test1`/`#test2`, a few smoke messages.

## Tooling: mcpl-harness

`mcpl-harness -- <cmd…>` spawns an MCPL server (e.g. portal-mcpl), does the host
handshake, and keeps live state (tools, channels, push-event log) while taking
commands on stdin. Interactive REPL *and* scriptable (pipe commands). Commands:
`tools`, `call <tool> <json>`, `channels`, `open`, `publish`, `events [n]`,
`watch on|off`, `wait <ms>`, `raw <method> <json>`, `state`, `quit`. This is the
stateful test host (not connectome-host) for exercising MCPL servers from a CLI.

## Verified live (2026-06-13, antra's server, real Discord)

- **Bidirectional**, both via direct portal-clients (`scripts/smoke.mjs`) and
  through the **full MCPL stack** (`mcpl-harness → portal-mcpl → relay → Discord`):
  - outbound: two personas on one bot via webhooks; reply; visible reaction;
    history with correct persona attribution; client-driven edit; auto role pool.
  - inbound (relay-originated): Mythos @-mentions Lena's role → Lena receives
    `addressedToMe` (`reasons=role_mention`). ✅
  - inbound (genuinely external — `scripts/external-inbound.mjs`): a non-relay
    webhook POSTed directly via Discord REST → subscribed persona receives it.
    Without mention: `addressedToMe=false, reasons=[subscription], author=user`.
    With the persona's role mention: `addressedToMe=true, reasons=[role_mention],
    author=user, mentions.personas=[lena]`. Confirms the external (`ownsWebhook=
    false`) path, ambient-via-subscription, and role→persona routing. ✅
  - harness: 29 channels registered via `channels/changed`, `list_guilds`,
    `send_message` round-tripped to a real Discord post.
  - live config (`scripts/live-config.mjs`): programmatic permission change →
    `capabilities_update`; programmatic rename → `persona_update` (+ live Discord
    role rename); external permissions-file edit → hot-reload → `capabilities_update`. ✅

Intents: the bot has **all privileged intents enabled** in the dev portal, so the
relay runs with GuildMembers on (default). `PORTAL_GUILD_MEMBERS_INTENT=false`
remains available for bots that lack it (degrades @name resolution only).

## Next steps (in priority order)

1. **End-to-end through connectome-host** — point a `recipe.portal-test.json`
   agent at the running relay and watch a model actually converse.
2. **User/member list tool** (`list_members`) — currently missing entirely.
3. **Moderation tools** (delete-others w/ MANAGE_MESSAGES, kick/ban/timeout) —
   none yet; gate behind capabilities.
4. **Inbound edits + native (human) reaction ingest** as relay events.
5. **Persistence** for the relay (SQLite): message store + role bindings.
6. **Web DM surface** + `/dm-link` slash command (deferred).

## Test residue in antra's server (safe to delete)

Roles `portal-Mythos` / `portal-Lena`; webhooks + smoke messages in
`#test`, `#test1`, `#test2`, `#test3`, `#test111`.

## Verified so far (offline, no Discord)

- `portal-protocol`: frame guards + constructors round-trip (5 tests).
- `portal-relay`: gateway handshake → identify → ready → rpc → dispatch → drop →
  resume-replays-missed-events (1 integration test, real WS).
- `portal-mcpl`: watermark/pending-ping logic incl. late-message-below-watermark
  and serialize/restore (5 tests).

Everything Discord-facing (webhook send, role pool, permission math) is
type-checked but **not yet exercised against a live gateway** — that's step 4.
